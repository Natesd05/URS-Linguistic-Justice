# URS-Linguistic-Justice
Programs and models developed by Nathan Han for the purpose of the Linguistic Justice research project headed by Dr. Shamya Karumbaiah.

This research project involved the testing of various different language detection models, and deciding whether or not they were a good fit for analyzing our corpus of spanish-english children books.

The two most promising models, fastText and LangId, are included in this repository.

This project also involed utlizing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to further derive information about our corpus.

For our purposes, stanza ended up being the most effective model for bilingual NER. The code I used to analyze our corpus is also included in this repository.
